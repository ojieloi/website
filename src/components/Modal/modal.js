          Growing up, I moved from contry to country - Nigeria to Ghana, a
          pit-stop in South Africa, then onwards to Kenya, and finally in the
          summer of 2012, the United States - New Jersey. Pretty certain itâ€™s
          because my mom got fed up with all the moving..

          I went through the entirety of high school not really knowing what I
          wanted to major in for Uni. I later settled on Computer and Electrical
          engineering, this was the period when I wrote my first ever bits of
          code - Java, eww.

        <Body className="modal-wrapper__body">
          During this period, I also picked up an interest in UI design after
          watching a series of YouTube videos on a software called Adobe XD,
          which was still in Beta at the time. Curios about it, I decided to
          pick that up, tried recreating some of my favorite apps, and the rest
          is history.

        <Body className="modal-wrapper__body">
          This was also the time I decided I wanted to focus more of the
          software creation side of development, so midway through my degree, I
          switched to Computer Science, ended up graduating Summa Cum Laude.
